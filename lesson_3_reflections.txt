When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Because it would be the easiest way to acess my work remotely. Plus, it is the best way
    to share my code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes made in the remote may have been by other people. I do not
    necessarily want to synchronize before seeing what the changed or added.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork creates my own version of someone else's repository.
    A clone copies an existing repository (remote or local).
    A branch represents a diverging version of a project in my repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
